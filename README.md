- doneInClass
    This folder holds all demos we did in class. There may be duplicated files in the classDemos folder, but there can be variations depending on student need and inquiry as well as potential time constraints.
- lectureExamples
    This folder holds all the code from the video lectures. The purpose of this is so that you can look at the code talked about in the lecture, pull it down and play around with it. It's okay to break it. In fact, experimenting and potentially breaking it is encouraged. It is one of the ways you learn what works and what does not.

  <!--
    a promise is something that will happen in the future. ex: requsting a web cam, we have to wait for the user to accept. Data retrieved from the web may succeed or fail, either way we have to wait for the data in order to process it.

      //a pizza takes time... and this oven can only bake one pizza at a time.
      //your order number/receipt is a promise that they will give you a pizza in the future (when it is finished).
      //instead of storing it as a variable, we can just return it.
      //changed to empty array because some people like pizza with no toppings. Crazy I know. We are going to change the return timing to add some time as per additional toppings.... so some pizzas will take longer to resolve than others.
      const amountOfTimeToBake = 500 + (toppings.length * 200);

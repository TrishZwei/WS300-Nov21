  <!--
    a promise is something that will happen in the future. ex: requsting a web cam, we have to wait for the user to accept. Data retrieved from the web may succeed or fail, either way we have to wait for the data in order to process it.

// })

//if there are a bunch of chained promises, the catch can just go at the end. 
//however, that then bails out where the chain failed and the other promises are not called. And this makes sense since your promise chain should be written based on dependancy... like if step 4 is dependend on step 3, if step 3 fails, then step 4 should not be called.

//if not all promises called are dependant, then you can make a mega promise (see dinnerPromise) and use .allSettled([p1,p2,p3]) (the promises you are calling....) and use then on that. all() assumes all are going to go through, if any are expected to be rejected you should use allSettled() OR a catch chained after the all()
